# 100DayCodingChallenge
This will the repository for my 100 day coding challenge 

After thinking for a bit of about what exactly I wanted to do, I have decided that I am going to remake a software that I never actually finish. 
It was the first actual useful software that I have ever attempted to do. 
However, this was for a competition and I had limited time. As a result, I never get to incorporate any of the things that I wanted to incorporate. 
I used the kivy module that was built for python software development. It was a disaster if I should say, as I 1) didn't plan whatsoever so the files are legit 
everywhere, 2) kivy was not a good choice as the documentation in my opinion wasn't coherent, and 3) I was not really good at programming. 

This time, however, I am going to plan intensively, before starting my project. The planning I do before I start my project would not be considered towards the 100 day challenge.
Also, I am planning to use React Native this time; thus, I need to understand how to write JS.
I will not be counting the time I used to learn JS into the 100 days challenge. 

In the near future I would probably be blogging my progress as I recreate my app.
